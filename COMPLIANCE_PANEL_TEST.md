# Compliance Panel Modal — Test Instructions

## Overview
The compliance panel now displays a **floating modal** that is **draggable**, **resizable**, and can **pop-out to a new window**. It also explains why certain steps are "pending" by showing a skip-step footer.

---

## Test Scenario 1: Simple Action (Shows Skip-Step Footer)

**Action:** Withdraw $100
- ✅ Click "💰 Withdraw" chip
- ✅ Agent processes request
- ✅ Compliance steps populate
- ✅ **Skip-step footer appears** at bottom:
  > "7 steps not triggered — gateway denial and HITL steps only fire on scope-upgrade or permission-required operations (e.g. Sensitive Account Details)."
- ✅ Check "Side panel" checkbox → Modal opens on left
- ✅ Drag the modal title bar → moves around screen
- ✅ Resize using corner handles → adjusts dimensions
- ✅ Click ↗ button → opens in new browser window
- ✅ Uncheck "Side panel" → back to inline view

**Why skip-step footer shows:**
- Simple withdraw doesn't require gateway denial checks
- No HITL (Human-In-The-Loop) consent needed
- Steps 4b-12a (gateway/HITL steps) remain pending

---

## Test Scenario 2: Sensitive Account Details (No Skip-Step Footer)

**Action:** View Sensitive Account Details
- ✅ Click "🔒 Sensitive Account Details" chip
- ✅ Agent processes request (triggers consent dialog)
- ✅ Compliance steps populate
- ✅ **Skip-step footer DOES NOT appear** (all steps applicable)
- ✅ Steps show:
  - Gateway scope mapping (gw-scope-map)
  - HITL challenge type (gw-hitl-challenge-type)
  - Agent error propagation
  - UI gateway consent
  - Claim diagnostics
- ✅ Modal still draggable and resizable
- ✅ Verify white background on all steps

**Why skip-step footer does NOT show:**
- Sensitive operations require ALL 10+ steps
- Gateway denial steps are fully applicable
- HITL consent steps are fully applicable
- No "pending" steps are skipped for this action

## Test Scenario 3: Test HITL Transfer (Shows Skip-Step Footer)

**Action:** Test HITL Transfer
- ✅ Scroll down in actions to find "Test HITL Transfer"
- ✅ Click the chip
- ✅ Compliance steps populate with mix of applicable/pending
- ✅ **Skip-step footer shows**
- ✅ Compare to Scenario 1 vs Scenario 2
