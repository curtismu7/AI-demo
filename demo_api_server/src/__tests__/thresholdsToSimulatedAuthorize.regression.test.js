/**
 * @file thresholdsToSimulatedAuthorize.regression.test.js
 *
 * Regression: a Setup-page / Demo-Controls threshold update (the keys
 * routes/thresholds.js writes) MUST change what the simulated Authorize
 * server actually enforces.
 *
 * Bug: thresholds.js wrote `confirm_threshold_usd` / `mfa_threshold_usd`, but
 * simulatedAuthorizeService reads ONLY `SIMULATED_AUTHORIZE_CONFIRM_AMOUNT` /
 * `SIMULATED_AUTHORIZE_STEPUP_AMOUNT`. Different key namespaces — case
 * normalization does not bridge differently-NAMED keys — so the AS silently
 * ignored every UI threshold edit and always used its defaults.
 *
 * Fix: thresholds.js mirror-writes the AS canonical keys alongside the HITL
 * keys. This test asserts the end-to-end contract WITHOUT loading server.js
 * (an unrelated pre-existing route load error blocks the full-app suite): it
 * exercises the same configStore write the route performs, then reads through
 * the real simulated AS getters and an actual decision.
