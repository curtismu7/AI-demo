/**
 * authorizeObligations.js
 *
 * Single source of truth for mapping a list of authorization obligations to the
 * three decision flags the BFF gates act on: { stepUpRequired, hitlRequired,
 * consentRequired }.
 *
 * Why this module exists (H2 fix): the obligation-type -> flag mapping used to
 * live in two places that silently disagreed —
 *   - pingOneAuthorizeService._extractStepUpRequired / _extractHitlRequired /
 *     _extractConsentRequired (regex over raw.obligations + raw.advice), where
 *     a `HITL_CONSENT` obligation matched BOTH the HITL and consent regexes; and
 *   - simulatedAuthorizeService, which emitted `STEP_UP` / `HITL` / `HITL_CONSENT`
 *     and set only one flag.
 * Same policy intent, different boolean tuples. Both engines now classify
 * through this one function so the mapping cannot drift.
 *
 * Contract (decided with the maintainer):
 *   - Input: a NORMALIZED array of obligation objects, each with a `type` or
 *     `id` string. Each engine is responsible for extracting/merging its own
 *     sources (PingOne merges raw.obligations + raw.advice + raw.details.*;
 *     simulated passes its flat obligations array). This module owns only the
 *     type -> flag mapping, which is the actual drift point.
 *   - Classification is MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE per obligation, most-specific wins:
 *       HITL_CONSENT            -> consent   (NOT also hitl)
 *       HITL / HUMAN_APPROVAL   -> hitl
 *       STEP_UP                 -> stepUp
 *   - The returned flags enforce HIGHEST-GATE-WINS across the whole list:
 *       stepUp  >  hitl/consent  >  (none)
 *     (DENY is a top-level decision, not an obligation, so it never reaches
 *     this classifier — by the time obligations are evaluated the decision is
 *     non-DENY.) When step-up is present anywhere in the list, ONLY
 *     stepUpRequired is true even if HITL/consent obligations also appear.
 *   - `classified` (the per-obligation breakdown) is returned alongside the
 *     winning booleans for education/UI ("also had a consent obligation"); it
 *     is informational only and MUST NOT drive enforcement.
