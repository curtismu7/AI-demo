# HITL Sequence Diagram — Step-by-Step Panel Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Replace the static Mermaid render on `/architecture/hitl` with a custom SVG renderer and interactive left panel that walks through each HITL consent flow step with `why`, `request/response`, `rulesEvaluated`, and `onError` explanations — matching the UX of `/sequence-diagram` exactly.

**Architecture:** New self-contained `HitlSequenceDiagram.js` holds all data (`HITL_PARTICIPANTS`, `HITL_STEPS`, `HITL_SCENARIOS`) and renders the custom SVG. `StepInfoPanel` and its helpers are copied verbatim from `SequenceDiagramPage.js`. `HitlSequencePage.jsx` is stripped of its Mermaid dependency and renders the new component instead.

**Tech Stack:** React 18 (CRA), inline styles, SVG, no new npm dependencies.

## Reference: Key patterns from SequenceDiagramPage.js

Before starting, understand these patterns — they are copied directly:

**Participant x-position formula:**
```js
const participantIndex = (id) => PARTICIPANTS.findIndex((p) => p.id === id);
const x = 100 + participantIndex(id) * 120;  // horizontal centre of each lifeline
```

**Step y-position formula:**
```js
const y = 120 + stepIndex * 20;  // vertical position of each step row
```

**Active/past/future colouring:**
```js
stroke={isActive ? "#004687" : isPast ? "#dbeafe" : "#cbd5e1"}
strokeWidth={isActive ? 3 : 1.5}
opacity={isPast ? 0.5 : 1}
```

**Simulation loop (2500ms per step, 4000ms hold on last):**
```js
steps.slice(startIdx).forEach((_, offset) => {
  const i = startIdx + offset;
  const t = setTimeout(() => {
    applyStep(i);
    if (i === steps.length - 1) {
      const done = setTimeout(() => { resetDiagram(); setIsSimulating(false); }, 4000);
      simTimeouts.current.push(done);
    }
  }, (offset + (startIdx === 0 ? 0 : 1)) * 2500);
  simTimeouts.current.push(t);
});
```

**Resizable panel drag:**
```js
const handleMouseDownResize = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const startX = e.clientX;
  const startWidth = leftPanelWidth;
  const handleMouseMove = (moveEvent) => {
    const deltaX = moveEvent.clientX - startX;
    const newWidth = Math.max(240, Math.min(500, startWidth + deltaX));
    setLeftPanelWidth(newWidth);
  };
  const handleMouseUp = () => {
    document.removeEventListener("mousemove", handleMouseMove);
    document.removeEventListener("mouseup", handleMouseUp);
  };
  document.addEventListener("mousemove", handleMouseMove);
  document.addEventListener("mouseup", handleMouseUp);
};
```

## Task 1: Scaffold HitlSequenceDiagram.js with participants and empty step array

**Files:**
- Create: `demo_api_ui/src/components/HitlSequenceDiagram.js`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the file with imports, participants, and empty HITL_STEPS**

```js
import { useState, useRef, useCallback, useEffect } from "react";

// HITL_PARTICIPANTS — matches hitl-sequence.mmd participant declarations
const HITL_PARTICIPANTS = [
  { id: "B",   label: "Browser" },
  { id: "BFF", label: "BFF (demo_api_server)" },
  { id: "TC",  label: "transactionConsent.js" },
  { id: "P1",  label: "PingOne MFA" },
];

// HITL_STEPS — populated in Task 2 and Task 3
const HITL_STEPS = [];

// HITL_SCENARIOS — populated in Task 4
const HITL_SCENARIOS = {
  all:       HITL_STEPS,
  homegrown: HITL_STEPS.filter((s) => s.path === "shared" || s.path === "homegrown"),
  onetime:   HITL_STEPS.filter((s) => s.path === "shared" || s.path === "onetime"),
  device:    HITL_STEPS.filter((s) => s.path === "shared" || s.path === "device"),
};

export default function HitlSequenceDiagram() {
  return <div style={{ padding: "1rem", color: "#475569" }}>Loading…</div>;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify it imports cleanly — no build errors**

```bash
cd demo_api_ui && npm run build 2>&1 | grep -E "ERROR|error TS|Failed" | head -10
```
Expected: no errors.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add demo_api_ui/src/components/HitlSequenceDiagram.js
git commit -m "feat(hitl): scaffold HitlSequenceDiagram with participants"
```

## Task 2: Add HITL_STEPS — shared preamble + Path 1 (Homegrown OTP)

**Files:**
- Modify: `demo_api_ui/src/components/HitlSequenceDiagram.js`

- [ ] **Step 2: Fix HITL_SCENARIOS to reference HITL_STEPS after it is fully populated**

Because `HITL_SCENARIOS` is defined with inline `.filter()` calls at module load time, it must be defined *after* `HITL_STEPS` is fully populated. Move `HITL_SCENARIOS` to immediately after the `HITL_STEPS` closing `];` :

```js
const HITL_SCENARIOS = {
  all:       HITL_STEPS,
  homegrown: HITL_STEPS.filter((s) => s.path === "shared" || s.path === "homegrown"),
  onetime:   HITL_STEPS.filter((s) => s.path === "shared" || s.path === "onetime"),
  device:    HITL_STEPS.filter((s) => s.path === "shared" || s.path === "device"),
};
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Build passes**

```bash
cd demo_api_ui && npm run build 2>&1 | grep -E "ERROR|error TS|Failed" | head -10
```
Expected: no errors.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add demo_api_ui/src/components/HitlSequenceDiagram.js
git commit -m "feat(hitl): add HITL_STEPS Path 2 (PingOne One-Time) + Path 3 (Device Picker)"
```

## Task 4: Copy StepInfoPanel and helpers from SequenceDiagramPage.js

**Files:**
- Modify: `demo_api_ui/src/components/HitlSequenceDiagram.js`

The following functions are copied verbatim from `SequenceDiagramPage.js`. They use only React hooks and inline styles — no external dependencies.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add FlowClaimRow, OneFlowCard, StepDetailSection, HttpDetailGrid, and StepInfoPanel to HitlSequenceDiagram.js**

Insert after the imports and before `HITL_PARTICIPANTS`. Copy these functions exactly from `SequenceDiagramPage.js` lines 24–695:

- `FlowClaimRow` (lines 24–72)
- `OneFlowCard` (lines 74–157)  
- `StepDetailSection` (lines 174–228)
- `HttpDetailGrid` (lines 233–265)
- `StepInfoPanel` (lines 267–696) — **one change required**: replace the reference to `PARTICIPANTS` on line 330 with `HITL_PARTICIPANTS`:

```js
// In StepInfoPanel, change:
const fromParticipant = PARTICIPANTS.find((p) => p.id === activeStep.from);
const toParticipant = PARTICIPANTS.find((p) => p.id === activeStep.to);
// To:
const fromParticipant = HITL_PARTICIPANTS.find((p) => p.id === activeStep.from);
const toParticipant = HITL_PARTICIPANTS.find((p) => p.id === activeStep.to);
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Build passes**

```bash
cd demo_api_ui && npm run build 2>&1 | grep -E "ERROR|error TS|Failed" | head -10
```
Expected: no errors.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add demo_api_ui/src/components/HitlSequenceDiagram.js
git commit -m "feat(hitl): copy StepInfoPanel and helpers into HitlSequenceDiagram"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Build passes**

```bash
cd demo_api_ui && npm run build 2>&1 | grep -E "ERROR|error TS|Failed" | head -10
```
Expected: no errors.

- [ ] **Step 3: Smoke test — SVG renders**

Navigate to `https://api.ping.demo:4000/architecture/hitl`. Confirm:
- 4 participant boxes render at top
- Lifelines extend downward
- All path background rects visible (green / blue / orange bands)
- Hit Simulate — arrows animate one by one, active arrow highlighted blue
- Pause — step panel shows `why`, request/response, rules, onError for current step
- Prev/Next navigate steps; step counter updates
- Scenario dropdown "Path 1 — Homegrown OTP" shows only shared + homegrown steps
- No console errors

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add demo_api_ui/src/components/HitlSequenceDiagram.js
git commit -m "feat(hitl): add custom SVG renderer with participant lifelines and path rects"
```

## Task 7: Update HitlSequencePage.jsx — strip Mermaid, render HitlSequenceDiagram

**Files:**
- Modify: `demo_api_ui/src/components/HitlSequencePage.jsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Replace the entire content of HitlSequencePage.jsx**

```js
/**
 * HitlSequencePage.jsx — /architecture/hitl
 *
 * Interactive sequence diagram for the HITL consent challenge flow.
 * Diagram and step-by-step panel are provided by HitlSequenceDiagram.js.
 * Source reference: hitl-sequence.mmd at the repo root.
 */
import HitlSequenceDiagram from "./HitlSequenceDiagram";

const PATHS = [
  { key: "homegrown", label: "Path 1 — Homegrown OTP",           color: "rgb(232,245,233)", desc: "BFF-generated HMAC OTP emailed directly. Feature flag: mode=homegrown." },
  { key: "onetime",   label: "Path 2 — PingOne One-Time (default)", color: "rgb(232,240,255)", desc: "PingOne sends OTP to user's email/phone on file. No enrolled device required. Feature flag: mode=onetime." },
  { key: "device",    label: "Path 3 — PingOne Device Picker",    color: "rgb(255,243,224)", desc: "User picks from enrolled devices (EMAIL, SMS, FIDO2). Requires amount >= $500. Feature flag: mode=device_picker." },
];

export default function HitlSequencePage() {
  return (
    <div style={{ padding: "2rem", maxWidth: "100%", overflowX: "auto" }}>
      <header style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "0.75rem", fontWeight: 600, textTransform: "uppercase", letterSpacing: "0.08em", color: "#6b7280", marginBottom: "0.25rem" }}>

      <div style={{ display: "flex", gap: "0.75rem", flexWrap: "wrap", marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
        {PATHS.map((p) => (
          <div key={p.key} style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "flex-start", gap: "0.5rem", background: "#f9fafb", border: "1px solid #e5e7eb", borderRadius: 8, padding: "0.6rem 0.9rem", maxWidth: 280 }}>

        ))}
      </div>

      <HitlSequenceDiagram />
    </div>
  );
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Build passes — mermaid is no longer imported**

```bash
cd demo_api_ui && npm run build 2>&1 | grep -E "ERROR|error TS|Failed" | head -10
```
Expected: no errors. Confirm `mermaid` is gone from this file:
```bash
grep "mermaid" demo_api_ui/src/components/HitlSequencePage.jsx
```
Expected: no output.

- [ ] **Step 3: Full smoke test**

Navigate to `https://api.ping.demo:4000/architecture/hitl`. Verify all spec acceptance criteria:
- Page loads, no console errors
- Path legend chips (green/blue/orange) render above the diagram
- Scenario dropdown: All Paths / Path 1 / Path 2 / Path 3 — switching filters correctly
- Simulate auto-walks all steps, step counter updates, resets after last step
- Pause → Prev/Next navigate; step panel shows description, why, request, response, rules, onError
- Active arrow highlighted blue, others dimmed
- All 4 panel sections have data on at least one step per path
- Zoom in/out scales the SVG

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add demo_api_ui/src/components/HitlSequencePage.jsx
git commit -m "feat(hitl): replace Mermaid render with HitlSequenceDiagram interactive step panel"
```

---

## Task 8: Final build verification

**Files:** None changed — verification only.

- [ ] **Step 1: Full production build**

```bash
cd demo_api_ui && npm run build 2>&1 | tail -5
```
Expected: "The build folder is ready to be deployed."

- [ ] **Step 2: No regression on /sequence-diagram**

Navigate to `https://api.ping.demo:4000/sequence-diagram`. Confirm it still loads and simulates correctly. No changes were made to `SequenceDiagramPage.js`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit (if any stray changes)**

```bash
git status
# If clean, no commit needed
```

## Self-Review

**Spec coverage check:**

| Spec requirement | Task |
|---|---|
| Every arrow = one step (~48 total) | Task 2 + 3 (51 steps: 5 shared + 9 P1 + 17 P2 + 17 P3 + 3 notes + closing note) |
| Scenario dropdown: All / P1 / P2 / P3 | Task 5 |
| Custom React SVG renderer | Task 6 |
| `why`, `request/response`, `rulesEvaluated`, `onError` per step | Task 2 + 3 (all steps have all four) |
| `StepInfoPanel` copied from SequenceDiagramPage.js | Task 4 |
| `HITL_PARTICIPANTS` 4 entries | Task 1 |
| Resizable panel, drag divider | Task 5 |
| Active arrow highlighted, others dimmed | Task 6 |
| Path background rects green/blue/orange | Task 6 |
| Remove mermaid import from HitlSequencePage.jsx | Task 7 |
| Keep page header + legend chips | Task 7 |
| `cd demo_api_ui && npm run build` exits 0 | Tasks 1–8 (every task) |

**Placeholder scan:** No TBDs or TODOs. All code blocks are complete. All step data has `why` and `onError`. All arrow steps have `request`/`response`.

**Type consistency:** `HITL_PARTICIPANTS`, `HITL_STEPS`, `HITL_SCENARIOS` defined in Task 1; extended in Tasks 2–3; consumed in Tasks 4–6. `participantIndex` defined in Task 5 and used in Task 6. `StepInfoPanel` props (`activeStep`, `currentStepIdx`, `steps`, `isPaused`, `onStepClick`, `panelWidth`) match what's passed in Task 5. `ctrlBtn` helper defined and used in Task 5.
