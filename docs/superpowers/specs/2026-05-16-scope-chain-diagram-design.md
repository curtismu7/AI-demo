# Scope Chain Diagram + `ai_agent` Scope Remediation — Design

**Date:** 2026-05-16 (remediation added 2026-05-17)
**Status:** Approved
**Author:** Curtis Muir (with Claude)

This spec covers two logically-separate workstreams, delivered as one plan:

1. **`ai_agent` scope remediation** (prerequisite) — fix a created-but-never-
   granted scope so the system is consistent before we draw it.
2. **Scope chain diagram** — the original standalone scope-narrowing diagram,
   drawn against the now-consistent system.

## Part 1 — `ai_agent` scope remediation (prerequisite)

### Problem

The bare, unprefixed OAuth scope `ai_agent` is **created** on the banking
resource (`pingoneProvisionService.js:1223`) and is **required** to call the
`query_user_by_email` MCP tool (`mcpWebSocketClient.js:52`,
`mcp-olb.openapi.json:120,122`) and the `/api/users/query/by-email/:email`
REST route (`routes/users.js:27` via `requireAIAgent`, whose `clientType`
derives from the `ai_agent` scope at `middleware/auth.js:58`). But **no
application is ever granted `ai_agent`** — all 12 `grantScopesToApplication`
calls grant prefixed scopes (`banking:ai:agent:read`, `banking:read/write`,
`banking:mcp:invoke`, `banking:agent:invoke`), never bare `ai_agent`. Net
effect: no real PingOne-issued token can carry `ai_agent`, so the tool/route
enforcement is an unreachable dead-end, and the diagram cannot truthfully show
this scope.

### Decision

The tool is intended for the delegated agent, which **is** granted
`banking:ai:agent:read`. Delete the dead `ai_agent` scope and consolidate the
two consumers + `clientType` derivation onto the already-granted, prefixed
`banking:ai:agent:read`.

### Changes (minimal, scoped)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `pingoneProvisionService.js:1223` | Remove `{ name: 'ai_agent', ... }` from created scopes |
| `services/mcpWebSocketClient.js:52` | `query_user_by_email: ['ai_agent']` → `['banking:ai:agent:read']` |
| `banking_mcp_server/openapi/mcp-olb.openapi.json:120,122` | `["ai_agent"]` → `["banking:ai:agent:read"]` (security + x-required-scopes) |
| `middleware/auth.js:31,58,~70/96,388` | Derive `clientType==='ai_agent'` from `banking:ai:agent:read` instead of bare `ai_agent`; `requireAIAgent` (:957) logic unchanged |
| `utils/oauthAuthorizeResource.js:29` | Drop `\|\| s === 'ai_agent'` (redundant — `banking:ai:agent:read` matches `startsWith('banking:')`) |
| `config/scopes.js:15,39,81,83` | Remove `AI_AGENT_IDENTITY: 'ai_agent'` + uses; fix legacy comment |
| `services/configStore.js:231,286,1127` | Remove dead `ai_agent_scope` key; drop bare `ai_agent` from grant string + agent-gateway allowlist |
| `REGRESSION_PLAN.md §4` | Bug Fix Log entry per regression-guard template |

### Verification

- Targeted tests pass: `npx jest auth users query_user_by_email` (nearest
  existing suites).
- `cd banking_mcp_server && npm run build` exits 0.
- Very-thorough re-search: zero bare `ai_agent` *scope* references remain
  (unrelated `AI_AGENT` app-type / `loginType` strings are out of scope).
- A token with `banking:ai:agent:read` still yields `clientType==='ai_agent'`
  and reaches `query_user_by_email` + the by-email route.
- `REGRESSION_PLAN.md` §0–1 read first; "what I will not break" stated before
  touching `middleware/auth.js` and provisioning.

## Part 2 — Scope chain diagram

### Problem

The Architecture section has a System Architecture diagram and a Token Exchange
Flow sequence diagram. The sequence diagram mentions scopes inline at various
hops but does not make the *scope narrowing* legible: a viewer cannot easily see
the exact scope set carried by each token and how RFC 8693 token exchange
narrows scopes at every step. There is no diagram dedicated to answering
"what scopes does each token have, and why."

## Goal

Add a standalone, zoomable **scope-narrowing diagram** that places the
**server (1-exchange)** and **agent (2-exchange delegation)** flows side by
side, with every token node labelled with its exact `aud` and scope set, so a
viewer can trace scope narrowing across token exchanges and understand the
RFC 8707 single-resource rule that shapes the 2-exchange path.

## Verified scope data (source of truth)

All scope strings below were extracted from code/config, not approximated.

### Server path — 1-exchange

| Step | Token | aud | Scopes carried | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Login | User subject token | banking-api | `banking:read banking:write` (subset of login grant) | `configStore.js:231` |
| RFC 8693 exchange | MCP token | `PINGONE_RESOURCE_MCP_SERVER_URI` | `banking:read banking:write banking:mcp:invoke` (default `mcp_token_exchange_scopes`) | `configStore.js:288`; allowlisted at `configStore.js:1141-1145` |
| Tool gate | validated at MCP server | — | per-tool `requiredScopes` (e.g. `banking:read`; `banking:write`; `banking:read banking:sensitive:read`; `query_user_by_email` → `banking:ai:agent:read` post-Part-1) | `BankingToolRegistry.ts:28,65,103,171`; `mcpWebSocketClient.js:52` |

### Agent path — 2-exchange delegation

| Step | Token | aud | Scopes carried | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Subject token | User | agent-gateway | `banking:read banking:write` | `configStore.js:231` |
| Actor CC (Exchange #1 actor) | Agent gateway CC | agent-gateway | `banking:ai:agent` (single CC scope; `agent_gateway_cc_scope`) | `agentMcpTokenService.js` (agent_gateway_cc_scope), allowlisted at `configStore.js:1125-1128` |
| Exchange #1 (RFC 8693) | Agent exchanged token | AI-Agent intermediate | `banking:mcp:invoke` only — RFC 8707 single-resource rule (T-10) | `agentMcpTokenService.js:1687-1689` |
| Exchange #2 (RFC 8693) | MCP/RS token | two-exchange resource server | `banking:read banking:write banking:mcp:invoke`, `act:{sub:agent}` chain preserved | `agentMcpTokenService.js` (final scopes); allowlisted at `configStore.js:1151-1155` |
| Tool gate | validated downstream | — | per-tool `requiredScopes` | `BankingToolRegistry.ts` |

> **Allowlist vs. token contents.** `buildAllowedScopesByAudience()` in
> `configStore.js` defines the RFC 8707 *validation allowlist* (which scopes
> *may* be requested against an audience), NOT what each minted token actually
> carries. The "Scopes carried" column above reflects what each token actually
> carries; the diagram teaches token contents, with the allowlist mentioned
> only as the gate that validates each request.
>
> **`ai_agent` (bare, unprefixed) is removed, not hidden.** Part 1 of this
> spec deletes the dead `ai_agent` scope and consolidates its only enforcement
> consumers (`query_user_by_email`, the by-email route, `clientType`
> derivation) onto the already-granted `banking:ai:agent:read`. The diagram is
> drawn against that consistent end state — `ai_agent` appears nowhere, and the
> `query_user_by_email` gate shows `banking:ai:agent:read`. The scope tables
> above already reflect the post-Part-1 system.

### Key teaching point

Exchange #1 deliberately narrows to a single `banking:mcp:invoke` scope to
satisfy the RFC 8707 single-resource rule (a token-exchange request may not span
scopes from multiple resources). Exchange #2 then re-requests the real tool
scopes against the final resource, while the `act` claim chain
(`act:{sub:agent}`) is preserved end-to-end. The diagram must make both the
narrowing at Exchange #1 and the re-widening at Exchange #2 visually obvious.

## Design

### Components / changes

1. **`scope-chain.mmd`** (new, repo root) — a Mermaid `flowchart` with two
   labelled lanes (Server / Agent). Each token is a node showing its `aud` and
   scope list. Edges are labelled with the governing RFC
   (`RFC 8693`, `RFC 8707 single-resource narrowing`). Per-tool gate shown as a
   terminal node listing representative `requiredScopes`.

2. **`scripts/build-diagrams.sh`** — add one additive `ENTRIES` row:
   `"scope-chain scope-chain.mmd ${OUT_DIR}/scope-chain.png 2800"`.
   The script already copies the `.mmd` next to the PNG so the UI can show
   source; no other change needed.

3. **`banking_api_ui/src/App.js`** — add a `scopes` sub-route under the
   existing `/architecture/*` route block, reusing the same zoomable
   image-viewer pattern already used by `/architecture/overview` (zoom steps,
   open-in-new-tab, scroll/pan container).

4. Render the PNG (`bash scripts/build-diagrams.sh scope-chain`) and run
   `cd banking_api_ui && npm run build` (exit 0).

### Out of scope (YAGNI)

- No new tab in `ArchitectureTabsPanel` — standalone route only (user decision).
- No live/interactive scope highlighting — static rendered PNG, consistent with
  the other architecture diagrams.
- No changes to token-exchange logic — diagram and routing only.

## Verification / success criteria

- `bash scripts/build-diagrams.sh scope-chain` renders `scope-chain.png` with
  zero failures.
- `cd banking_api_ui && npm run build` exits 0.
- `/architecture/scopes` loads the zoomable image and is reachable.
- Every scope string in the rendered diagram matches the verified table above.
- No `REGRESSION_PLAN.md` §1 protected file is modified destructively — the
  `App.js` route addition and `build-diagrams.sh` entry are both additive.
