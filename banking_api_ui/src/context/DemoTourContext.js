    action: null,
  },
  {
    title: "Flow 1 — Customer Login (Auth Code + PKCE)",
    body: "A customer authenticates via Authorization Code + PKCE. The browser only receives a session cookie — tokens never touch the client. The BFF holds all OAuth tokens securely server-side.",
    action: { label: "Go to login", route: "/" },

  {
    title: "Dashboard — Banking Agent + Quick Chips",
    body: "After login the dashboard shows the Banking Agent. Use the quick-action chips (My Accounts, Check Balance, Transfer) to trigger common commands. Simple queries take the heuristic fast path — no LLM call needed.",

  {
    title: "Agent Tool Call — RFC 8693 Token Exchange",

    title: "2-Exchange Delegation — act Claim",
    body: "The default path runs two exchanges: (1) user token → AI agent token (carrying may_act), then (2) AI agent token → MCP token with a nested act claim. The act claim proves the agent acted on behalf of the user — verifiable by any downstream service.",

  {
    title: "Flow 2 — Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Consent",
    body: "Transfers above the HITL threshold require explicit human approval before the agent can proceed. The agent pauses, a consent modal appears on the dashboard, and the user approves or denies — the agent continues or stops based on the decision.",
    action: {
      label: "Try: Transfer $600 from Savings",
      hint: "Use the chip or type it in the agent — a consent modal will appear",
    },
  },
  {
    title: "HITL — Approve or Deny",
    body: "The consent modal shows the exact transaction the agent wants to perform. Approve to let it proceed; deny to block it. The agent receives the decision and either completes the tool call or returns a clear refusal to the user.",
    action: {
      hint: "Approve or Deny in the consent modal — watch the agent respond to your decision",
    },
  },
  {
    title: "Flow 3 — CIBA (Out-of-Band Approval)",
    body: "For step-up scenarios, the agent can trigger a CIBA push to the user's registered device. The app polls for approval and unblocks automatically when the user approves — no page refresh needed.",
    action: {
      hint: "Enable CIBA in Configuration → Feature Flags, then trigger a high-value transfer",
    },
  },
  {
    title: "WebMCP — Browser-Native MCP Inspection",
    body: "The WebMCP page lets you browse all registered MCP tools, inspect input schemas, call tools directly, and watch streaming token-exchange events — the same execution path used by the AI agent, all from the browser.",
    action: { label: "Open WebMCP", route: "/webmcp" },

    title: "Tour complete",
    body: "You've seen PKCE login, RFC 8693 2-exchange delegation with act claims, HITL consent gates, CIBA out-of-band approval, and live MCP tool execution. Use the Learning section in the Admin sidebar to go deeper on any topic.",
