        <Term
          name="Artificial Intelligence (AI)"
          href="https://www.nist.gov/artificial-intelligence"
        >
          A field of computer science dedicated to building systems that process information in a way that mimics cognitive functions. It is an umbrella term for many different technologies and should not be used to describe a specific product or feature without further qualification.
        </Term>

        <Term
          name="Machine Learning (ML)"
          href="https://www.iso.org/standard/74442.html"
        >
          A specific approach to AI where a system is trained on data to identify patterns and make decisions. Unlike traditional software, which relies on hard-coded logic, ML models adjust their internal parameters based on the data they ingest.
        </Term>

        <Term
          name="Large Language Model (LLM)"
          href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762"
        >
          A sophisticated statistical model trained on massive text datasets to predict the next most likely word or token in a sequence. An LLM is a reasoning engine, not a database. It does not store facts in a structured table, but rather stores weights or associations between concepts. Responses are probabilistic: a given answer is the most likely sequence of words based on training, not a verified lookup.
        </Term>

        <Term
          name="Generative AI"
          href="https://airc.nist.gov/AI_Glossary"
        >
          A subset of AI models focused on creating new data that resembles the training data. While traditional AI might classify an existing image, Generative AI creates a new one.
        </Term>

        <Term
          name="Agent"
          href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-agents"
        >
          A software system that uses an LLM to perceive its environment, reason about how to achieve a goal, and execute actions via external tools. An important distinction: the chat interface a user types into is not the agent itself; it is a presentation layer, or frontend. The agent is the backend reasoning and execution layer that manages tasks, calls tools, and orchestrates workflows autonomously.
        </Term>

        <Term name="Agentic AI">
          A system architecture where the primary logic is driven by autonomous agents. This move from chat-based AI to agentic AI represents a shift from a user asking questions to a user delegating complex workflows to a system that can work independently.
        </Term>

        <Term
          name="Model Context Protocol (MCP)"
          href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io"
        >
          An open standard designed to enable seamless, secure integration between AI models and local or remote data sources. MCP is a protocol, not a proxy or a data warehouse. It defines the communication schema so that any model can interact with any data source that implements the standard, without custom integration code for every connection.
        </Term>

        <Term
          name="Identity and Access Management (IAM)"
          href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/"
        >
          A security framework for managing digital identities. In AI contexts, IAM ensures that an agent only accesses data or performs actions that the specific user or service account is authorized to execute.
        </Term>

        <Term
          name="Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)"
          href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401"
        >
          An architecture that allows an LLM to access specific, up-to-date data during a conversation by retrieving relevant documents from an external source and providing them to the model as context. RAG exists because LLMs are not real-time systems like search engines; they are limited by a fixed training cutoff date. RAG augments the reasoning capabilities of the model with information it was not originally trained on.

      <Section title="Distinguishing LLMs from Databases">
        <p style={{ margin: 0, fontSize: '0.875rem', color: '#374151', lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          A common misconception is treating a Large Language Model as a database or a search engine. A database stores exact data points that can be retrieved with 100% fidelity. An LLM is a probabilistic engine. When it provides an answer, it is calculating the most likely sequence of words based on its training. If the model is not provided with external data via RAG or MCP, it may generate hallucinations, which are responses that sound plausible but are factually incorrect.
        </p>

      <Section title="The Role of MCP as a Universal Interface">
        <p style={{ margin: 0, fontSize: '0.875rem', color: '#374151', lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          In many customer environments, data is siloed across different applications and servers. Historically, to give an AI access to this data, a developer would have to write custom APIs or proxy layers for every single connection. The Model Context Protocol provides a standardized way for an agent to say "show me the files in this folder" or "query this database" using a common language. By implementing MCP, a company ensures that their AI tools are interoperable and that the model can be swapped out or upgraded without rewriting the data connections.

        <p style={{ margin: '0 0 0.75rem', fontSize: '0.875rem', color: '#374151', lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          While the current market focus is on Generative AI, customers may also encounter Predictive or Discriminative AI.

        <ul style={{ margin: 0, padding: '0 0 0 1.4rem', fontSize: '0.875rem', color: '#374151', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
          <li>Predictive AI uses historical data to forecast future events, such as inventory needs or equipment failure.</li>
          <li>Discriminative AI is used to categorize data, such as identifying whether an email is spam or whether a medical image shows a specific condition.</li>
          <li>Generative AI differs because its primary output is a new synthesis of information rather than a label or a numerical forecast.</li>
        </ul>
        <Note>These distinctions rarely surface in typical AI agent conversations, but knowing them prevents confusion when customers reference them.</Note>

      <Section title="Simple RAG vs. Agentic RAG">
        <p style={{ margin: 0, fontSize: '0.875rem', color: '#374151', lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          Simple RAG is a linear process: a user asks a question, the system looks up a document, and the model summarizes it. Agentic RAG is more advanced because the agent can evaluate the quality of the information it finds. If the initial search results are insufficient or contradictory, an agent can decide to search a different database, refine its search terms, or ask the user for more clarification. This creates a more reliable and robust system for complex technical or legal inquiries.
        </p>
        <Note>Think of Simple RAG as a researcher who reads one book. Agentic RAG is a researcher who reads one book, decides it is not sufficient, and goes to find three more.</Note>

      <Section title="Securing Agents with IAM">
        <p style={{ margin: 0, fontSize: '0.875rem', color: '#374151', lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          When an AI agent is given the ability to take actions, such as updating a customer record in a CRM, it must be treated as a distinct identity within the network. This requires applying the Principle of Least Privilege. An agent should never be given admin access by default. Instead, IAM policies should be configured so that the agent operates under a service account with the minimum permissions necessary to perform its specific task. This ensures that even if an agentic system misinterprets a prompt, the potential for unauthorized data access or system damage is restricted.

      <Section title="What Makes a Prompt Effective">
        <p style={{ margin: '0 0 0.75rem', fontSize: '0.875rem', color: '#374151', lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          A successful prompt is not a simple question. It is a structured set of requirements. A professional prompt typically includes four components:
        </p>
        <StepList steps={[
          'Context: The background information or role the model should assume.',
          'Goals: A clear description of the problem the model needs to solve.',
          'Outcomes: The specific format, length, or tone expected for the output.',
          'Constraints: The rules the model must follow, such as what to avoid or what data to prioritize.',
        ]} />
        <p style={{ margin: '0.75rem 0 0', fontSize: '0.875rem', color: '#374151', lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          If prompts are simplistic and lack these details, the model is forced to fill in the gaps with its own statistical biases. This often leads to underspecification, where the AI provides a generic answer that fails to meet the actual technical or business need.

        </p>
        <ul style={{ margin: 0, padding: '0 0 0 1.4rem', fontSize: '0.875rem', color: '#374151', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>

          <li><strong>User prompt:</strong> The instruction provided at runtime by the human or an orchestrating system.</li>
          <li><strong>Tool result injection:</strong> Structured data returned by MCP tools is appended to the context window before the model generates its next response.</li>
        </ul>
        <Note>A well-engineered system prompt is the primary defense against prompt injection. If an adversary can override the system prompt through user input, the agent's behavior becomes unpredictable and potentially dangerous.</Note>
